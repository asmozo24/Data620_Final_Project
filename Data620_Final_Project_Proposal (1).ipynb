    "    \n",
    "1. data source: In this project, We will use collected data available online through popular job sites. This will be a collections of data. It is going to be tidious a little bit. An alternate solution is to copy\n",
    "    the link where the job descriotion is but other information not related to the job description will add biais to the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Understanding how sentiment analysis work in order to answer the research questions can be difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpreting Results: This is going to be crucial. How to present the result, wouldn't it be better to have the results in \n",
    "    summary ? \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bonuses: we want to explore the sentiment analysis on recorded video. We will use the \"2022 CUNY SPS Commencement Ceremony\" and \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will help job seekers to better understand the job description. Ultimately, this project could potentially lead to \n",
